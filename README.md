Star Trek VS Star Wars: Which Universe Has Better Data?

Data is everywhere, and it can tell us many stories about the world we live in. But data is not always uniform, consistent, or easy to analyze. Sometimes, data reflects the characteristics of its source, and we can learn something about the nature of that source by examining the data. In this project, I will compare two sources of data that are very different from each other: Star Wars and Star Trek. These are two of the most popular and influential science fiction franchises in history, and they have generated a vast amount of data in various media, such as movies, books, TV shows, comics, video games, and online databases. However, these two franchises also have very different styles, themes, and philosophies, which may affect how their data is structured, organized, and presented. By scraping data from Wookieepedia, the online encyclopedia of Star Wars, and STAPI, the Star Trek API, I will compare and contrast the data of these two universes in four categories: characters, species, astronomical objects, and spacecrafts. I will also explore how the data structure for each universe resembles the respective universe itself. For example, Star Trek data is more clean, categorized, and standardized, reflecting its vision of a rational and orderly future; while Star Wars data is more messy, descriptive, and diverse, reflecting its depiction of a chaotic and adventurous galaxy. My main objectives are to demonstrate how data can be used to analyze and compare different fictional worlds, and to show how data can reveal something about the nature and culture of its source.
